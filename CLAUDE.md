# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Hard rules

- **RLS** — always enable Row Level Security on new Supabase tables with granular per-operation, per-role policies.
- **API routes** — must export `const prerender = false`. Use uppercase `GET`, `POST` exports. Validate input with zod.
- **API errors** — return `{ error: { code: string, message: string } }`. `code` is snake_case (e.g. `invalid_body`, `internal_error`). HTTP 400 for validation, 500 for unexpected. Do NOT include `status` in the body.
- **Path alias** — `@/*` maps to `./src/*` (tsconfig paths).
- **Tailwind class merging** — use the `cn()` helper from `@/lib/utils` (clsx + tailwind-merge) for conditional/merged class names. Do not concatenate class strings manually.
- **Supabase migrations** — naming format `YYYYMMDDHHmmss_short_description.sql` under `supabase/migrations/`.
- **Shared types** — entities, DTOs go in `src/types.ts`.
- **React** — no Next.js directives ("use client" etc.). Extract hooks to `src/components/hooks/`.
- **Skills must not write to `context/archive/`**. Archived changes are immutable; if a resolved target path starts with `context/archive/`, abort with: "This change is archived. Open a new change with `/10x-new` instead."

## Project: Astro + Supabase + Cloudflare

Scaffolded from `10x-astro-starter`. The sections below describe the application that lives in `src/`, `public/`, `supabase/`, etc.

### Product

LuminaClean AI — night/low-light photo denoise + exposure-correction MVP. Two engines behind a Strategy toggle: cloud AI (Bread on Replicate via async pipeline: signed upload → DB webhook → Edge Function → Replicate prediction → webhook callback → Supabase Realtime push) and a local Canvas fallback (gamma + Gaussian blur). Cloud is auth-gated and rate-limited (20 ops/user/24h via SQL on RLS-gated tables). See @idea-notes.md for full MVP scope and explicit non-goals.

### Commands

- `npm run dev` — start Astro dev server (Node/Vite — **not** the Cloudflare workerd runtime; use `npm run build && npx wrangler dev` for workerd fidelity)
- `npm run build` — production build (SSR via `@astrojs/cloudflare`)
- `npm run preview` — preview production build
- `npm run lint` — ESLint with type-checked rules
- `npm run lint:fix` — auto-fix lint issues
- `npm run format` — Prettier (includes prettier-plugin-astro + prettier-plugin-tailwindcss)

Pre-commit hooks: husky + lint-staged runs `eslint --fix` on `*.{ts,tsx,astro}` and `prettier --write` on `*.{json,css,md}`.

### Architecture

**Astro 6 SSR app** with React 19 islands, Tailwind 4, Supabase auth, and shadcn/ui components. Deployed to Cloudflare Workers.

#### Rendering mode

Full server-side rendering (`output: "server"` in astro.config.mjs). All pages are server-rendered by default. (See Hard rules for the `const prerender = false` requirement on API routes.)

#### Auth flow

- `src/lib/supabase.ts` — creates a Supabase SSR client using `@supabase/ssr` with cookie-based sessions. Uses `astro:env/server` for `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY` (server-only secrets declared in astro.config.mjs `env.schema`).
- `src/middleware.ts` — runs on every request, resolves the current user, attaches to `context.locals.user`. Redirects unauthenticated users away from routes listed in `PROTECTED_ROUTES`.
- API endpoints: `src/pages/api/auth/{signin,signup,signout}.ts`
- Auth pages: `src/pages/auth/{signin,signup,confirm-email}.astro`
- Protected page example: `src/pages/dashboard.astro`

#### Key conventions

- **Astro components** for static content/layout; **React components** only when interactivity is needed.
- **shadcn/ui**: components live in `src/components/ui/`, "new-york" style variant. Install new ones with `npx shadcn@latest add [name]`.
- **Services/helpers** go in `src/lib/` (or `src/lib/services/<feature>.service.ts` for extracted business logic, e.g. `src/lib/services/photo-upload.service.ts`).

(See Hard rules above for `cn()` usage, the `@/*` path alias, API route conventions, Supabase migration naming, `types.ts`, and React directives.)

### Environment

- Node.js v22.14.0 (see `.nvmrc`)
- Env vars: `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_KEY` (copy `.env.example` to `.env` for Node, or `.dev.vars` for Cloudflare local dev)
- Local Supabase: `npx supabase start` (requires Docker)
- Cloudflare local dev: secrets go in `.dev.vars` (gitignored)
- Deploy: `npx wrangler deploy` (requires Cloudflare account + `wrangler` auth)
- **Production manual config** (custom domain + DNS, Supabase auth URLs + custom SMTP, Resend, GitHub secrets) is a **runtime prerequisite for the MVP, not in the repo** — the deployed Worker serves, but the MVP (accounts, auth email, branded domain) does not function without it. Full required setup: `context/foundation/production-config.md`.

### CI

GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs lint + build on every push and PR to master. Requires `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY` repository secrets for the build step.

## 10x-cli profile & workflow

- Active profile is **Claude Code**: skills live under `.claude/skills/` and this `CLAUDE.md` is the canonical rules file. Verify with `10x doctor`. To switch profiles (e.g. Codex CLI under `.agents/`), re-run `10x get <ref> --tool <name>`; the CLI will prompt to migrate existing artifacts.
- Lesson artifacts (skills, prompts, rules, config templates) are managed via the CLI, not edited by hand. `10x list` browses; `10x get <ref>` (e.g. `10x get m1l1`) fetches and applies a bundle; `10x get <ref> --dry-run` previews; `10x doctor` diagnoses auth, API, config, and tool-directory issues.
- Re-fetching a different lesson cleans up artifacts from the previous lesson that aren't in the new one. Hand-editing files under `.claude/skills/` will be overwritten on the next `10x get` for the same lesson.
- **Upstream README is authoritative** for install/usage: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/przeprogramowani/10x-cli/refs/heads/master/README.md`. If memory and the README disagree, follow the README.
- **Run `10x doctor` before guessing** at CLI failures — it covers auth, API reachability, config, version, and tool-directory presence.
- **Auth is interactive (magic link).** If a shell can't accept input, ask the user to run `10x auth` themselves via the `!` prefix.
- Deeper guidance: `.claude/skills/10x-cli-setup/SKILL.md` (first-time install / re-auth / tool reconfiguration) and `.claude/skills/10x-cli-guide/SKILL.md` (daily-usage reference, troubleshooting matrix, platform tips).

### Archive workflow extensions (durable fallback)

These behaviors were added to `.claude/skills/10x-archive/SKILL.md` (step 6) but live here too because a `10x get` re-fetch can overwrite the managed skill. **When archiving a change** (via `/10x-archive` or equivalent), after the base move + stamp + roadmap-item close, also:

- **Refresh status across the other tracking md files** (best-effort, never blocks): in `context/foundation/roadmap.md` flip the matching **Backlog Handoff** table row to `done` with an `Archived <date> → <archive-path>. Issue #<n>.` note; in `context/foundation/github-issues.md` set the final-mapping **Status** cell for the change to `done` and append a row to its `## Status updates` log (`| date | roadmap-id | #issue | action |`). These follow `github-issues.md`'s own note that issue state should stay in sync with the roadmap `Status` on archive.
- **Sync the matching GitHub issue** (outward-facing → confirm first): resolve the issue number from `github-issues.md` (or `gh issue list`), then **ask once** before mutating; on approval `gh issue close <n> --comment "Archived <date> → <archive-path> (commit <sha>)."`. `gh` failures are non-fatal; never close/comment without explicit consent. Pattern precedent: issues #1–#4 were closed on archive.

## Repository status

This repository is a **10xDevs course workspace** that has been bootstrapped with an Astro 6 application (Supabase + Cloudflare Workers). Two layers of artifacts coexist:

- **Course artifacts** managed by `@przeprogramowani/10x-cli`:
  - `skills-lock.json` — pins the skills fetched from the course CLI (source: `przeprogramowani/10x-cli` on GitHub) with content hashes.
  - `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` — skill bundles pulled in by `10x get`.
- **Application code** scaffolded from `10x-astro-starter` — see "Project: Astro + Supabase + Cloudflare" above for commands, architecture, and conventions. Bootstrap audit trail lives at `context/changes/bootstrap-verification/verification.md`.

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 3, Lesson 1

Open Module 3 by producing a **durable, risk-first quality contract** before any test is written — then drive each rollout phase through the standard change chain.

```
PRD + roadmap + archive
        │
        ▼
   /10x-test-plan  ──►  context/foundation/test-plan.md  (strategy §1–§5 frozen + cookbook §6 grows)
        │
        ▼  (one rollout phase at a time, /clear between handoffs)
   /10x-new ──► /10x-research ──► /10x-plan ──► /10x-implement
```

`/10x-test-plan` is a **stateful orchestrator**, not a one-shot generator. On first run it writes the phased rollout to `context/foundation/test-plan.md`. On every subsequent run it re-derives state from on-disk artifacts and presents the next handoff. The lesson focus is **strategy and rollout sequencing, not configuration**. Hooks, MCP servers, and CI YAML are configured in later lessons of this module.

### Task Router - Where to start

| Skill | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| **Quality strategy as a rules-file (lesson focus)** | |
| `/10x-test-plan` | You have a PRD (and ideally a roadmap and a few archived slices) and you are about to write the project's first tests, or you noticed that AI-generated tests are landing on helpers while critical flows go uncovered. First invocation runs discovery (PRD + roadmap + archive + hot-spot scan), a 5-question user interview, and a synthesis pass with a mandatory challenger check, then writes `test-plan.md` in `context/foundation/` with a risk map (5–7 failure scenarios), a phased rollout table, a stack table, a quality-gates table, a cookbook section (`§6`, fills in as phases ship), and a negative-space section (what we deliberately don't test). Subsequent invocations advance the rollout one handoff at a time. |
| `/10x-test-plan --status` | A `test-plan.md` already exists and you want a compact snapshot of where the rollout stands — which phases are `not started`, `change opened`, `researched`, `planned`, `implementing`, or `complete`, and what the next action is. Does no work; safe to run any time. |
| `/10x-test-plan --refresh` | A `test-plan.md` already exists and one of: a new top-3 risk surfaced from the roadmap or archive, a tool's `checked:` date is older than three months, the project's tech stack changed, or §7 negative-space no longer matches what the team believes. Opens a new `test-plan-refresh-<YYYY-MM-DD>` change folder rather than editing the guide in place. |

### Rollout chain — what happens after the guide is written

The guide's §3 *Phased Rollout* table is the orchestrator's state. For each non-`complete` row the orchestrator selects the next handoff based on which artifacts exist in `context/changes/<change-id>/`:

| State on disk | Next handoff | Status transitions to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| change folder missing | `/10x-new <change-id>` | `change opened` |
| `change.md` only | `/10x-research` (with a risks-to-verify brief) | `researched` |
| `+ research.md` | `/10x-plan` (with cost × signal + cookbook-update constraints) | `planned` |
| `+ plan.md` with pending `## Progress` items | `/10x-implement <change-id> phase <N>` | `implementing` / `complete` |
| `+ plan.md` fully `[x]` | Mark §3 row `complete`; loop to next pending row | — |

Each handoff is a **STOP point**. The orchestrator copies the next command to the clipboard, asks the user to `/clear` and run it, then exits. Re-invoke `/10x-test-plan` (no arguments) to advance.

### Risk-first prioritization rules

- Risks are **failure scenarios in user / business terms**, not test names. "Logged-out user reaches paid content via stale token" is a risk; "test the login form" is not.
- 5 to 7 risks. Fewer is too coarse; more makes prioritization useless.
- Impact and likelihood are user/business ratings, not technical complexity.
- Every risk traces to a source: PRD section, archived slice, roadmap entry, Phase 2 interview question, hot-spot **directory** with churn count, or a tech-stack constraint. No invented risks.
- **Signal, not knowledge.** §2 cites *evidence that raised the risk*, never a file as "where the failure lives." File:line anchors, function names, schema names, and module names are forbidden in §2 — they belong in `/10x-research`'s output, produced per rollout phase against current code. The plan is a QA spec; it is not a code audit.
- Coverage is not the metric. **Risk coverage** is the metric.

### Dual-layer mapping rules

- Classic layer first: the cheapest test that gives a real signal wins. Promote to e2e only when no cheaper layer covers the risk.
- AI-native layer second, and only where it adds signal classic tests do not give cheaply.
- Every AI-native row has a **"When NOT to use"** line. If you cannot write one, drop the row.
- Every tool name carries a `checked: <YYYY-MM-DD>` date. Tool names are examples of the category, not endorsements.
- Both layers must be non-empty in the final guide if the project warrants them. Classic-only is a 2020 plan; AI-native-only is hype. AI-native phases are not mandatory — include them only when the brief justified them under cost × signal.

### Quality gates rules

- Required gates (lint, typecheck, unit+integration, e2e on critical flows) must map to actual CI steps. If a required gate is not yet wired, mark it as `required after §3 Phase <N>` and let the named rollout phase wire it.
- Post-edit hook is **recommended local**, not a CI substitute.
- Multimodal visual review is **selective**, applied to 1–3 critical screens, not to every page.
- Vision-driven fallback (Anthropic Computer Use or OpenAI CUA) is reserved for DOM-unreachable surfaces; expensive per action.

### Cookbook patterns (§6) — fills in over time

`test-plan.md` is both a phased strategy and a **growing cookbook**. §6 starts as placeholders (`TBD — see §3 Phase <N>`) and fills in incrementally — each rollout phase's plan ends with a sub-phase that updates the relevant §6 entry (location, naming, reference test, run command). After Module 3 completes, §6 becomes the canonical answer to "how do I add a test for X in this project?" — and is what `/10x-tdd` reads in Lesson 2.

### Lesson boundaries

- Do not write test code. That is Lesson 2 (`/10x-tdd` and unit-test authoring).
- Do not configure hooks, hook lifecycle, or debugging hooks. That is Lesson 3.
- Do not configure MCP servers, Playwright API, e2e code, or multimodal scenario code. That is Lesson 4.
- Do not run the bug-to-fix-to-regression-test workflow. That is Lesson 5.
- Do not author CI/CD pipelines from scratch or write GitHub Actions YAML. The guide names gates; configuration is owned by Module 1 Lesson 5 and Module 2 Lesson 5.
- Do not benchmark multimodal models. Cite criteria (cost, latency, agent-friendliness), never a ranking.
- Do not read the codebase for knowledge (call graphs, schemas, "which file owns this failure"). That is `/10x-research`'s job, per rollout phase.

### Paths used by this lesson

- `context/foundation/test-plan.md` — the quality contract produced and maintained by `/10x-test-plan`
- `context/foundation/prd.md` — primary risk source
- `context/foundation/roadmap.md` — likelihood weighting
- `context/foundation/tech-stack.md` — stack input (when present)
- `context/archive/<change-id>/plan.md` — implemented risk surface
- `context/changes/<change-id>/` — per-rollout-phase change folder (one per row in §3)
